# React Query Presentation

This is the repository for my React Query presentation.

This branch (`main`) contains the actual presentation files, including the slides and any additional resources.

There are two more branches with the demo application:

- [`demo-app`](../demo-app): This branch contains the beginning state (pure React, not React Query) of the demo application that I converted. during the presentation
- [`demo-app-converted`](../demo-app-converted): This branch contains the same application, converted to use React Query (the end state of the presentation)
